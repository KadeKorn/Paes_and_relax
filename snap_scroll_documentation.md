# Snap Scroll Feature Documentation

## Implementation

The snap scroll feature has been implemented in the Paws & Relax website to provide a smooth, section-by-section scrolling experience. This document outlines the implementation details, usage instructions, and known limitations.

### CSS Properties

The following CSS properties were used to implement the snap scroll feature:

```css
body {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
  overflow-y: scroll;
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}

.section {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

These properties ensure that each section takes up the full viewport height and snaps into place when scrolling.

### Application to Sections

In the `App.js` file, each main section of the website is wrapped in a `Box` component with the `className="section"`:

```jsx
<VStack spacing={0} align="stretch">
  <Box className="section">
    <HomePage />
  </Box>
  <Box className="section">
    <AboutUs />
  </Box>
  <Box className="section">
    <ServicesPage />
  </Box>
  <Box className="section">
    <BookingSection />
  </Box>
  <Box className="section">
    <TestimonialsPage />
  </Box>
</VStack>
```

This structure allows the CSS snap scroll properties to be applied to each main section of the website.

## Usage Instructions

The snap scroll feature works automatically when users scroll through the website. No additional user action is required to activate the feature. Users can navigate through sections by scrolling or using the navigation menu.

## Dependencies

No additional libraries or dependencies were used for the snap scroll implementation. It relies solely on CSS properties and React component structure, specifically utilizing Chakra UI's `Box` and `VStack` components for layout.

## Browser Compatibility

Due to environment limitations, comprehensive browser testing was not possible. However, the feature is expected to work in modern browsers that support CSS Scroll Snap. Further testing is recommended in the following browsers:

- Chrome (desktop and mobile)
- Firefox (desktop and mobile)
- Safari (desktop and mobile)
- Edge (desktop)
- Samsung Internet (mobile)

## Known Limitations and Issues

1. Broken logo image in the header
2. Broken image in the "About" section content
3. Manifest.json syntax error
4. Failed resource load from placeholder images in testimonials section
5. Accessibility and keyboard navigation testing was limited due to environment constraints
6. The snap scroll feature may interfere with smooth scrolling for users who prefer continuous scrolling

## Recommendations

1. Conduct thorough cross-browser testing to ensure consistent behavior
2. Address the broken images and resource loading issues
3. Verify and improve keyboard navigation for accessibility
4. Consider adding smooth transitions between sections for a more polished user experience
5. Implement a way to disable snap scrolling for users who prefer continuous scrolling
6. Ensure that all interactive elements are reachable and usable with keyboard navigation

## Accessibility Considerations

While snap scrolling can enhance the user experience, it may pose challenges for some users, particularly those relying on assistive technologies. Consider the following:

1. Ensure that all content is accessible via keyboard navigation
2. Provide clear visual indicators of the current section
3. Consider adding ARIA landmarks to improve navigation for screen reader users
4. Test the website with various assistive technologies to ensure compatibility

## Conclusion

The snap scroll feature enhances the user experience by providing a smooth, section-based navigation. However, addressing the known issues, conducting further testing, and considering accessibility implications are crucial for optimal performance and inclusivity across all devices and browsers.
